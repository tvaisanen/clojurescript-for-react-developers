* Common Libraries and Advanced Interop

Let's take a look how to use a couple of the common React
libraries in CLJS and learn by example how the inter-op
looks like and how to translate between JS and CLJS.

** React Router

#+attr_latex: :options linenos
#+include: app/src/main/app/react_router_app.cljs src clojure

** React Query

Install the library

#+begin_src bash
‚ùØ npm install react-query
#+end_src

https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html#_using_npm_packages

Create new file =query.cljs= where we'll setup a lightweight wrapper for
React Query so we do not need to worry about the interop at the view
or component level.

#+attr_latex: :options linenos
#+include: app/src/main/app/query.cljs src clojure

Now that we have our own interface for the library let's put it to use.

#+attr_latex: :options linenos
#+include: app/src/main/app/react_query_app.cljs src clojure

TODO

** React Intl
